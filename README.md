# Visual Studio Code - IntelliJ Mapping
Copy the `VSCode.xml` file in the mapping folder.

On Windows, the mapping directory can be folder under `<user folder>\<intelliJ folder>\config\keymaps`

PS: This is not an extensive Key mapping. I change it and commit it along the way for the features I use within IntelliJ. If you have keymaps that you would like to see integrated, don't hesitate to create a Pull Request and I will gladly accept contributions.
